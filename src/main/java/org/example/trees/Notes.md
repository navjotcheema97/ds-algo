Trees


TreeNode {
    Value,
    List<TreeNode> childrens
}


Only one direction of path from top to bottom

Depth Of a Node => Distance of that node from root, i.e no of edges

Height(Node) => Distance of that node from the farthest leave

Trees: Graph without cycles

N nodes => (N-1) edges because every node other than root node has
an edge on top


K-ary Tree => If all nodes have less than and equal to k children
